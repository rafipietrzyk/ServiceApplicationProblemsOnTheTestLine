# ServiceApplicationProblemsOnTheTestLine

https://github.com/rafipietrzyk/ServiceApplicationProblemsOnTheTestLine.git

The service has two types of users: The operator of the testing line, who uses the service to send the report to the engineering department if there is any issues with the tests; and the process engineer who receives the report, deals with the problem, closes the report and finally writes up how the issue was dealt with. An additional function of this service is that all reported problems are stored in a database which if you choose the right function, will transfer the data into Excel.

In this project the following technologies were used:

PHP, 
HTML, 
CSS, 
MySQL
